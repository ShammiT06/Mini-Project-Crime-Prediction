Crime Prediction and Forecasting using Machine Learning and Deep Learning


Project Overview


This project explores the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for predicting and forecasting crime occurrences based on historical data. Utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which includes details such as longitude, latitude, place, and date of crimes, this project aims to identify patterns and trends in crime data to provide insights for law enforcement and community safety.



Objectives


Analyze and preprocess crime data to prepare it for modeling.
Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM) to predict future crime occurrences.
Visualize crime hotspots and trends over time using geospatial analysis.
Develop a forecasting model to anticipate future crime incidents.


Dataset


The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains the following features:

Longitude: The longitudinal coordinate of the crime location.


Latitude: The latitudinal coordinate of the crime location.


Place: Description of the crime location.


Date: Date of the crime incident.


Technologies Used:


Programming Language: Python


Libraries:


Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy


Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
